# Automata Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of efficient automata algorithms in the C programming language. These algorithms are designed to solve various computational problems related to formal languages and automata theory.

**Algorithms:**

* **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton):**
    * **Definition:** A DFA is a mathematical model that represents a finite state machine. It consists of a finite set of states, a set of input symbols, a transition function that determines the next state based on the current state and input symbol, a start state, and a set of accepting states. 
    * **Key Characteristics:**
        - **Deterministic:** For each state and input symbol, there is exactly one transition.
        - **Finite:** The number of states is finite.

* **NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton):**
    * **Definition:** Similar to a DFA, but with the following key difference: for a given state and input symbol, there can be multiple possible next states or no transition at all.
    * **Key Characteristics:**
        - **Non-deterministic:** Multiple transitions are possible from a given state and input.
        - **Epsilon Transitions:** NFAs can have transitions without consuming any input symbol (called epsilon transitions).

* **CFG (Context-Free Grammar):**
    * **Definition:** A CFG is a formal grammar that describes a formal language. It consists of a set of terminal symbols (the symbols that make up the language), a set of non-terminal symbols (variables that represent intermediate stages of the derivation), a start symbol, and a set of production rules.
    * **Key Characteristics:**
        - **Context-Free:** The production rules are of the form "non-terminal symbol â†’ string of terminals and non-terminals." The replacement of a non-terminal symbol is independent of the surrounding context.

* **[Add other algorithms, e.g., Pushdown Automata (PDA), Turing Machines (if applicable)]**

**Features:**

* **Efficiency:** The algorithms are implemented with a focus on efficiency and performance.
* **Modularity:** The code is well-structured and modular, making it easy to understand and maintain.
* **Comments:** The code includes clear and concise comments to explain the logic and functionality.
